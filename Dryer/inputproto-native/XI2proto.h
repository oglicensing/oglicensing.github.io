/* Conventions for this file:
 * Names:
 * structs: always typedef'd, prefixed with xXI, CamelCase
 * struct members: lower_case_with_underscores
 *        Exceptions: reqType, ReqType, repType, RepType, sequenceNumber are
 *        named as such for historical reasons.
 * request opcodes: X_XIRequestName as CamelCase
 * defines: defines used in client applications must go in XI2.h
 *          defines used only in protocol handling: XISOMENAME
 *
 * Data types: unless there is a historical name for a datatype (e.g.
 * Window), use stdint types specifying the size of the datatype.
 * historical data type names must be defined and undefined at the top and
 * end of the file.
 *
 * General:
 * spaces, not tabs.
 * structs specific to a request or reply added before the request
 *      definition. structs used in more than one request, reply or event
 *      appended to the common structs section before the definition of the
 *      first request.
 * members of structs vertically aligned on column 16 if datatypes permit.
 *      otherwise alingned on next available 8n column.
